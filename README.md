## Project

Create a Survey Application, where users can login and fill forms. The responses should be saved in a backend database. Create an Admin dashboard, where the data of the filled forms is visible to the admin only.

A survey form is similar to what we see in Google Forms with different field types like text fields, text areas, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc. You can also try and add validations if you feel certain fields are required to be filled by the user. You are free to choose the fields of the survey and the UI of the application. Just ensure that you are using different types of fields in the form.
For the admin dashboard, think what all information would be required for the admin and how it should be presented so that it is most useful. You can even be creative and as a bonus create graphs for the admin to understand patterns in the data.

Create the application using ReactJS/Typescript - NodeJS technologies. Use the database of your choice (SQL / NoSQL).

Implement a password-less login for the application. You can use the service is : `https://auth0.com/passwordless` or any other such free service

Host the application on a free hosting service like Netlify, Heroku, etc. and submit the deployed URL and the git repository of the code.
